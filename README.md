# marketstockanalysis

This project is a sample of Spark Streaming applicaton.
This can be easily plugged in with a PubSub Data Stream Generator like Kafka and process the data. The code is easily understandable, I believe.

It computes four stock analysis operations on JSON Stock data consuned as Dstream:

- Compute Maximum Profit
- Compute Simple Moving Average
- Compute RSI
- Compute Trading Volume
